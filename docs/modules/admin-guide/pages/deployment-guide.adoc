== Staging Environment

Our CI is automatically building the service when a new commit is detected in the `main` branch.
This includes the service and all related images as well. Images are pushed to quay.io registry.

Once this is done, the automatic deployment to staging begins using Helm. After a successful deployment
xref:developer-guide:testing.adoc[e2e tests] are running. Only when everything passes the CI job completes successfully.
