# SBOMer API

The API is documented using Swagger. You can view it at the `/api` endpoint of a deployment.

For staging development it can be reached at: https://sbomer-pct-security-tooling.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/api/.

Locally you can run the application in development mode and head to http://localhost:8080/api.
