# LOCAL OVERLAY
#
# This overlay is used to deploy SBOMer onto a local Kubernetes cluster.
# Please note that it does not use any images built by the CI!
#
# In order to successfully deploy the service you need to build images manually
# and make them available within the local Kubernetes nodes.
#
# This overlay is used by developers to test full deployment of
# SBOmer locally, with latest changes made to the images.
#
# Below you can see list of all resources expected to be deployed by this overlay:
